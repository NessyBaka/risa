You may wanna know why [risa](https://github.com/aneyo/risa)? Thing is - I like to name my projects with my beloved Character's or VA's names, and it so happened that 4 days before the project was created it was an [Imai Lisa's](http://bandori.wikia.com/wiki/Imai_Lisa) birthday (25.08), so yeah... ~~I had no choice~~.  
Also you might ask _why **R**isa instead of **L**isa?_ Well, [there's some phonetic differences between Japanese L and English L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_of_English_/r/_and_/l/_by_Japanese_speakers) and I like Japanese pronunciation more so I used it as a project name :)

**TLDR: _There's no meaning in this project name whatsoever_**

_i might change name back to Lisa cause Risa sounds like rizz(a)._

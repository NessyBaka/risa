## Currently, the collection is unmaintened. More updates coming soon i guess
Current skins will stay here for now.  
All I want to say: **the site is still working, but no new skins will be added**
## 

**Risa** - an old _small_ project that was used to serve a _small_ skin collection for game called [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)

## [2 years btw - aneyo.github.io/risa](https://aneyo.github.io/risa/)

You may wanna know why [risa](https://github.com/aneyo/risa)? Thing is - I like to name my projects with my beloved Character's or VA's names, and it so happened that 4 days before the project was created it was a [Imai Lisa's](http://bandori.wikia.com/wiki/Imai_Lisa) birthday (25.08), so yeah, ~~I had no choice~~.  
Also you might ask *why **R**isa instead of **L**isa?*  Well, [there's some phonetical differences between Japanese L and English L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_of_English_/r/_and_/l/_by_Japanese_speakers) and I like Japanese pronunciation more so I used it as a project name :)

> There's no meaning in this project name whatsoever

## ~~Things to do~~

- [x] Stop hosting skin files at Pages hosting **Important**
- [x] Dark Theme (cause I know that you don't like light themes)
- [ ] ~~Multi-language support~~
- [x] ~~Finish skin parser *(I should make another repo for this one)*~~ repo soon‚Ñ¢
- [ ] ~~Skin search filters~~
- [ ] Finish the rework !!!!!!!

Working on more complex version rn.

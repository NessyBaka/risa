**Risa** - a _small_ project created to "host" a _small_ skin collection for a game called [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)

## [**risa**.aneyo.live](http://risa.aneyo.live/)

You may wanna know why [risa](https://github.com/aneyo/risa)? Thing is - I like to name my projects with my beloved Character's or VA's names, and it so happened that 4 days before the project was created it was a [Imai Lisa's](http://bandori.wikia.com/wiki/Imai_Lisa) birthday (25.08), so yeah, ~~I had no choice~~.  
Also you might ask *why **R**isa instead of **L**isa?*  Well, [there's some phonetical differences between Japanese L and English L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_of_English_/r/_and_/l/_by_Japanese_speakers) and I like Japanese pronunciation more so I used it as a project name :)

> There's no meaning in this project name whatsoever

## Things to do

- [x] Dark Theme (cause I know that you don't like light themes)
- [ ] ~~Multi-language support~~
- [ ] Finish skin parser *(I should make another repo for this one)*
- [ ] ~~Skin search filters~~
- [ ] Stop hosting skin files at Pages hosting
- [ ] Finish the rework

Well, there's a *new* version coming soon™

## What keeps risa working ♥️

- [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) - Main framework
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font icons, these guys are *awesome*!
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) - *Lightweight [fuzzy-search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) library*, It's really **that** good
- [cmp-cc/vue-cookies](https://github.com/cmp-cc/vue-cookies) - Vue plugin to work with cookies 🍪
- [raw.githack](https://raw.githack.com/) - Where raw svg from github is hosted for [readme file](https://github.com/aneyo/risa/blob/master/README.md) ♥

## Also

Don't ever host libs at your site's repo

![oh no](https://i.imgur.com/vAQpvfF.png)

> ~~most of issues came from vue.js package so I should remove it lol~~ done, use CDN services for that or you can just add these files to [`.codebeatignore`](https://github.com/aneyo/risa/blob/master/.codebeatignore)

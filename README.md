# Risa Project

Risa - is a small project writen by aneyo.

## [risa.nessy.pw](https://risa.nessy.pw) or [a.nessy.pw](https://a.nessy.pw)

You may wanna know why risa? - well, it just a thing that I like to name my projects with my loved characters/VA names, so in 25th of august (4 days before this project was created) was [Imai Lisa](http://bandori.wikia.com/wiki/Imai_Lisa) birthday, so yeah `Lisa => Risa`.
> There's no meaning in this project name whatsoever

This project is replacement for [skins.nessy.pw](http://skins.nessy.pw) / [GitHub Page](https://github.com/NessyBaka/akogare)(Akogare skin project)  
Soon `skins.` sub-domain will refer to this project

## Things to do:

- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Finish skin parser
- [ ] Placeholder server

more to come, I think...

## Things that was used in this project:

- [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) - all the dynamic stuff
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - styles (although, I still used some of my stylesheets)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - (TODO) skin parser, used to add skins into [`meta.json`](https://github.com/NessyBaka/risa/blob/master/meta.json)
